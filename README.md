# Employee Insights and Attrition Analysis

## Project Summary
This project analyzes factors impacting employee performance and attrition rates in a corporate environment. The goal is to derive actionable insights to help reduce employee turnover and improve retention.
- This analysis also aims to provide insights into employee satisfaction levels to optimize HR strategies.

## Purpose and Goals
- Understand key determinants of employee attrition.
- Create predictive models to forecast which employees are likely to leave.
- Provide data-driven recommendations for HR strategies.
- Offer strategies for improving employee retention based on performance data.

## Data Description
- The dataset includes detailed employee records such as age, education, job satisfaction, and income levels, helping to create a comprehensive analysis of workforce trends.
- Data also includes factors like years at the company, department, and marital status, offering diverse demographic insights.

## Key Insights and Discoveries
- Strong correlations between low job satisfaction, income levels, and attrition.
- Younger employees with less experience are more likely to leave.
- Employees in high-stress roles or with less work-life balance tend to have higher attrition rates.

## Predictive Modeling Techniques
- A logistic regression model was built to predict attrition with high accuracy.
- Performance metrics like accuracy, recall, and F1 score were used to evaluate the model.
- Additional machine learning techniques such as decision trees and random forests could be explored to improve model performance.

## Grouping and Clustering
- Clustering techniques were applied to segment employees into different groups based on job role, satisfaction, and productivity.
- These clusters provide insights into which employee groups are at higher risk of leaving.
- Grouping employees by demographic variables like age and education level reveals patterns that can help customize HR strategies.

## Data Visualizations
- **Heatmaps**: Show correlations between factors like age, income, and job satisfaction.
- **Boxplots**: Compare income distributions across various job roles and satisfaction levels.
- **Scatter Plots**: Visualize trends between age, income, and attrition likelihood.
- **Pairplots**: Show how multiple variables like age, distance from home, and job satisfaction interact with attrition.

## Conclusion and Strategic Recommendations
- Improving job satisfaction and offering competitive salary increases can reduce attrition.
- Employees in specific job roles with lower income and job satisfaction are at the highest risk for turnover.
- Regular engagement surveys and more targeted interventions, such as training and development programs, can boost employee retention.
